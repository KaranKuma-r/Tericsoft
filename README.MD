# User Directory

This is a small React project where I fetch user data from a public API and display it in a card layout.

## Features

- Fetch data from API
- Show users in cards
- Error handling
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet and desktop)

## Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Axios
- CSS Grid

## Project Structure

I divided the project into components for better understanding:

- UserDisplay → handles API call and state
- UserCard → used to display individual user data

This helped me learn how to pass data using props and reuse components.

## API Used

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users


## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
